XML: Extensible Markup Language
	- create documents made up of user defined tags
		<someTagName>someValue</someTagName>
	- designed to describe data in a structured manner
	- Not for presentation
	
	Uses:
		- transfer data
			- over the internet
			- could be used for apps to communicate
		- configuration files for frameworks (how used in Spring and Maven)
		- data storage
		
	Benefits:
		- platform independent
		- network protocal neutral
		
	Valid vs. Well-Formed
		
	"Well-Formed" = syntactically correct
	"Valid" = conforms to a DTD or XSD, checks the structure of the xml, optional
	DTD - Document Type Definition
		- tags with regular expressions *older
	XSD - XML Schema Definition
		- allows for datatypes
		
XML Parsers: (specific to the framework your using)
	DOM - Document Object Model
		- pulls entire document into memory
		- creates a tree to store all the data
		- Can edit document
		- Random Access
	
	SAX	- Simple API for XML Parsing
		- Event Driven
		- very little of the document is stored in memory at any given time
		- goes through line by line
		- quicker
		- used by the DOM parser
