			SOAP	 vs.	REST

Contract	WSDL			no contract

Security	built-in		not built-in
			ws-security		(HTTPS)
			
Transaction	built-in		no
			ws-transaction
			
Reliable	built-in		no
Messaging	ws-reliable-
			messaging
		
tools-based	yes				no
			(soap-engine)
			
transport	http, sftp,		http/https 
protocol	smpt, ....

message		xml				xml, json, plain-text
language
support

Not a very fair comparison...

SOAP is a messaging protocol,

but REST is an architecture

REST is built off of HTTP.

REST
	- REpresentational State Transfer
	- transfering a representation of the state of our resources
	- Resource, some data we hold in the application
	- built off of HTTP
	- is a stateless web service
	
	
HTTP
	- hyper text transfer protocol
	- methods
		- Get - Post - Put - Delete
		
	Idempotent - an operation done 1 time has the same result as that operation being done 1-x times. 
	
	Safe - does not effect the state of the application
	
			SAFE		IDEMPOTENT
	GET		yes			yes
	
	POST	no			no
	
	PUT		no			yes

	DELETE	no			yes
